This spreadsheet is the public GNU GPLv3 release of [this spreadsheet](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/221086/Dungeon-Master-Excel-Toolkit) available on the Dungeon Master's Guild. You won't be able to do much actual DMing with this version since i had to remove so much of the Wizards of the coast owned content that isn't permissable in this license. But, before i stopped maintaining this sheet i wanted to be certain that i made my code available in an open source way in case anyone wanted to continue development.

I've poured so much time and energy into this spreadsheet over the years so hopefully some folks can still get some use out of it.
